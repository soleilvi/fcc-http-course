JSON:
- JavaScript Object Notation
- For easily getting raw data from a URL (server)
- Essentially a JavaScript object in text form
- Formatted in name/value pairs

URLs:
- You can extract the domain name from a URL using URL(urlStr).hostname
- The URL() API in general is what you would usually use to handle URLs

Asynchronous functions:
- "async" keyword: equivalent to returning a new Promise object
- "await" keyword: waits for a Promise to be either resolved or rejected
- Run simultaneous to other processes in your program
- Commonly used to execute I/O functions without interfering with the frontend
  - I/O examples:
    - HTTP requests
    - Reading files from hard drive
    - Interacting with Bluetooth devices
  - I/O timings:
    - RAM (ex. creating and fetching variables): nanoseconds, use synchronous
    - Disk (ex. fetching files from computer): 1 millisecond or less, either 
      sync or async
    - Network (ex. HTTP requests): 100 - 2000 milliseconds, use asynchronous
